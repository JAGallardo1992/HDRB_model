# HDRB_model
This is a step-by-step implementation of the model proposed by Gallardo et al. (2023) for simulating the shear behavior of High Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRBs). It is not the most efficient, but it is simple to follow. It includes Matlab and Python implementations; meanwhile, the OpenSees implementation will be available soon.

For more details about the model, the reader can refer to:
