# HDRB_model
This is a step by step implementation of the model proposed by Gallardo et al. for simulating the shear behavior of High Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRBs). It includes Matlab and Python implementation, the OpenSees implementation will be available soon.

For detail about the model, reader can refer to:
