# HDRB_model: High Damping Rubber Bearing Simulation Models

## Overview

This repository provides step-by-step implementations of detailed numerical models for simulating the behavior of High Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRBs). These implementations prioritize clarity and ease of understanding, making them ideal for educational purposes, research, and adaptation, rather than focusing primarily on computational efficiency.

The models are available in the following programming environments:
* Matlab
* Python
* OpenSees

## Implemented Models

The repository includes the following models:

### 1. Shear Model (2D_model)

This model simulates the non-linear shear behavior of HDRBs under shear loading.

**Based on:**
Gallardo, J. A., de la Llera, J. C., Restrepo, J. I., & Chen, M. (2023). A numerical model for non-linear shear behavior of high damping rubber bearings. _Engineering Structures_, 289, 116234. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2023.116234

### 2. Multi-axial Model (3D_model)

This model addresses the complex multi-axial behavior of HDRBs.

**Based on:**
Gallardo J., Chen M., Restrepo J., and de la Llera J. Modeling the multi-axial behavior of High Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRBs). _Under review in Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics_.

## Examples
This repository includes examples that replicate the simulations presented in the referenced papers.

## Support and Contributions

**Contact:**
For support with the models, assistance with compiling the OpenSees source code (which includes these custom HDRB implementations), or to provide comments, suggestions, and recommendations, please contact:
